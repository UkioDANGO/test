"The following day greets me with warm glow of the rising sun."
"I still feel uneasy about the previous night and although I have bonded with Ranok, I think I might have stumbled upon something I’d be better off without."
"Something wrong transpired yesterday, but I don’t know what."
"Did the wolf cross the line by sneaking up on me in the middle of the night?"
"I shake my head in dismissal."
"It’s not that."
"The wolf is quirky, true, but nothing else than kind and caring."
"I throw off the blanket, deceived by the warm hues flooding the room, only to realise it is a really cold morning."
"Gently, I check the wooden floor with my toe and a jolt of cold shoots upwards through my body."
"There is no other way around it; I simply hop off the bed with both feet immediately stinging in discomfort, but it doesn’t last long."
"I am more concerned by the slight shivers caused by my naked skin."
"Pity that Ranok doesn’t have any shirts, but at the same time why would he; he is a wolf with fur covering him head to toe."
"I envy him the comfort of his coat, it’s very warm and cosy."
"Memory of snuggling into his chest only empowers the sensation of chill creeping down my back and I notice goose bumps appearing on my skin."
"This leaves me in a rather peculiar situation, where I have to fashion some form of toga out of my bed linen."
"Once I am satisfied with my handywork, I approach the window to look at the forest outside."

"I ask, dipping the toast in yolk and chewing on it idly."

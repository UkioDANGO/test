"'The Six Tribes of Tirnan'"
"Just as I remembered."
"The table of contents shows that the book divides into six sections, each dedicated to one tribe."
"The tribes are as follows; Tirnan, Brecillien, Guldiren, Arden, Lothien and Anwynn."
"Sounds like an introduction to Lord of the Rings…"
"…the boring edition."
"Wait… wasn't there like an accompanying textbook that very few people read?"
"'Silver-million', or something among those lines."
"Ugh…"
"Those things I remember make me feel like I'm reliving my very own freaking fairy tale."

"Albeit I realise he's not as well situated as they usually are, given his domain consists of this very rustic cottage."
"Although charming, it's more fitting for the seven dwarves."
"I chuckle and return to my read."
"Tirnan, along with Brecillien compose the Heart of the Forest."
"They also share a majestic lake between them, called Tremelin."
"Apparently, it's a breath-taking stretch of water, and the description almost makes me wish for a visit there."
"It's a favourite summer spot for local wolves; pups have been playing in the shallows for generations, while others lounge around the beaches."
"A lake in the woods does seem like a perfect holiday spot, not going to lie."
"According to tradition, the lake itself is enchanted, and its waters have healing powers thanks to a fey residing within its depths."
"I smile, realising those wolves, as fantastical as they seem, have legends of their own to share."
"Thanks to deep familial ties and shared folklore, Tirnan and Brecillien were allied for many centuries."
"It would seem that the militarised way of life those wolves enjoy is driven from millennia old tradition of warfare."
"Whenever they're not fighting others, they fight amongst themselves."
"Another ally of Tirnan, although less faithful and much younger seems to be Arden, also called the High Forest."
"It's inhabited by the oldest and tallest trees, reaching all the way back to the youth of Sylvan."
"The wolves living there take deep pride in their ancient heritage and are extremely protective of their woods."
"Considering what happened to the tiger noble, I wonder what that extreme protectiveness entails."
"Can't be more extreme than killing someone over grafitti."
"Guldiren is the northernmost reach of the woods."
"The wolves there are strong and industrious and have a reputation for warmongering."
"Given the militant nature of Tirnan wolves, again I wonder what that means."
"The book does not keep me hanging."
"Turns out, it means that Guldiren was an instigator of nearly half of all wars, within and without these woods."
"Lothien stretches the mountain range hidden deep within the forest, with the highest peak called Amon Silva."
"That's where the respective tribe takes its residence."
"According to the book, Lothien flip-flopped during many conflicts, changing sides often more than once depending on the current winner."
"Pragmatic, but frowned upon by the remaining tribes for lack of loyalty."
"Guess Ranok was right about it being a wolven virtue; which in a mixed bag of goods is definitely a redeeming gem of a quality."
"Last place, called the Deep Forest, is Anwynn."
"It is described as a trove of the most beautiful of groves and meadows, filled with bounty and joy."
"Wolves of Anwynn surprisingly value peace and merriment, rarely if ever participating in conflicts started by the other tribes."
"Despite the book trying to paint them as debauched and decadent, I see them as quite the opposite."
"Especially since the description frowns upon Anwynn's openness to trade with the outsiders."
"Had it not been for Ranok, I would've wondered why I haven't ended up in that forest instead."
"I chuckle, but my amusement doesn't last long."
"The more pages I flick through, the more details I stumble upon I would be better left without."
"Despite dates and names meaning nothing to me, I can make general sense of decades upon decades of systematic warfare."
"The tribes either banded together to raid and pillage otherkin in nearby realms, or if such consensus should not be reached, raided each-other."
"The book glorifies one hero after another, describing how many burrows they put to the claw, or how many enemies laid slain under their paws."
"It became increasingly uncomfortable, especially since most of the targets were the otherkin… specifically of the Sylvan variety."
"I really hope this is just a history book… and the current affairs are much different."

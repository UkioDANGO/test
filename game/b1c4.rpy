"I just chuckle, shaking off this little side-tracking thought."
"I guess it doesn't really matter."
"I recline comfortably, set on giving the book another go."
"Apparently the first major battle of the rebellion took place right here, in Tirnan."
"The Tigerii and Sylvan Folk decimated an entire leonine army within these woods."
"It was a first defeat dealt to the lions which proved to the otherkin of Avalan that their overlords are not invincible."
"From that point onward the rebellion grew in scope, with more creatures banding together to overthrow the tyrants."
"The rest of the book is filled with dates and names; a very crowded parade of characters spanning nearly a century of conflict."
"I try to pay as much attention to detail as possible, but considering I really have no context for any of this, most of the information goes in one eye and out the other."

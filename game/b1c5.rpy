"Surely, I’ve seen woods in my life but they never seemed this… natural, almost undisturbed by the hand of men."

"I touch the trees as I pass them, noticing some having their names already claimed."
"It's an odd feeling, knowing that each of them represents a person."

"Her tree is a young, slender birch and unlike other carvings, this one is still bleeding sap."

"I decide to continue my walk, slowly meandering between different trees and shrubs when I suddenly come to a stop."
"My eyes open wide at an unexpected, yet in retrospect an inevitable sight."
"I cover my lips, overwhelmed by a surprising torrent of sadness washing over me."
"A tree in front of me, huge and sprawling has its name crossed out; beneath a moonstone tied around the trunk signifies that a wolf's journey has come to an end and he has been laid to rest here."
"It must've stood here for decades, if not centuries... looking down upon those who would pass by."
"And now it looks down upon me."
"I approach slowly, surprised by my own reverence, stopping mere inches before an ancient, rusty sword half grown into the trunk."
"I can only assume it means I’m face to face with a once mighty warrior."
"I struggle to decipher the crossed-out etchings."

"I exhale, patting the mighty trunk as I walk off."
"The deeper I venture, the more trees I see with moonstones glistening in the light; waning, waxing, quarter moons… entire generations of wolves resting peacefully over the watchful gaze of their goddess."
"Although I feel out of place, the welcoming sensation persists… bidding me to follow."
"I feel ashamed, remorseful even about the comments I’ve made about these trees."
"Seeing them now; an entire forest standing as testament to the tribes history and linage… I understand the significance."
"It's a living cemetery."
"I can only imagine how upset I would be if someone desecrated a resting place of my dearly departed."
"I wish I could take it all back…"
"But the moonlight doesn’t waver, almost as if absolving me of my foolish transgressions."

"The night is at its thickest, which means dawn is not too far."
"I begin slowly dozing off, just listening to his rhythmic breathing on the other side of the doors."
"But then, a question stirs me up, like a cold water slushed into my face."

"I mean… it is the case to a degree."
"Perhaps not exactly in the fashion of me calling him 'mine', but… similar possessiveness."
"It's flattering, I guess; in a messed up sort of way."
"Which is fitting my current circumstance."
"As the morning stretches into an afternoon, I think about means of killing some time."
"I remember the chief asking me if I came from Fhreyfall."

"I find the tome in the bedroom, lying on the windowsill."
"'Brief History of Fhreyfall'"
"I place the book on the bed and fetch myself a cup of ale, knowing full well it will be a laboursome read."
"I sit myself comfortably on the mattress, my back resting against the headboard and I simply flip the cover."
"The opening is a gruelling task to get through, again filled with names and dates that mean very little to me."
"However, the one thing that sticks out is the namesake herself- Fhrey."
"Apparently, she was a sorceress of great power back in the Age of Men… from context, I assume humans once ruled over this world… although the book so far doesn't state what exactly caused the situation to change."
"Fhrey was part of what the book refers to as Pantheon; a group of exceptionally gifted individuals who guided early humans."
"It seems this book is a part of a series, as it often refers to another title called 'Twilight of Men', which apparently deals with the breaking of the Pantheons."
"It would seem Fhrey's clique wasn't the only one overseeing the development of mankind; different Pantheons looked after their own tribes, often competing with one another."
"I cannot help but feel like all of this is vaguely familiar."
"Anyway, Fhrey had her last stand in the lands east of here, where she fell defeated by the Aspects… whatever that means."
"Ever since, the area was forever known as Fhreyfall… to commemorate the valiant defiance of the sorceress and her attempts to save mankind from targeted genocide."
"Thanks to her noble sacrifice, the Aspects weren't able to wipe out all of humanity and were forced to retreat into hiding."
"From the ashes of their once mighty empires, the remaining humans formed what is called Successor Kingdoms; petty realms which forever after struggled to survive against the tide of the beastfolk."
"I shut the book with confusion."
"This leaves more questions than gives me answers."
"And I don't think I like to learn I'm an extinct species…"
"…it just doesn't feel right."
"Vague familiarity aside, this now reads like a poorly written fiction."
"However… since I'm here… I cannot help but feel unsettled by this information."
"Am I really from this world?"
"Am I a part of a dying race?"
"The bigger question is, why would the Aspects, whoever they are, want to wipe out humanity to begin with?"
"Sure, we have some issues… but these wolves don't seem to be saints either."
"If there are some supervising beings looking over this world… I think one verbal and two written ones would be a better policy rather than skipping straight to a global-scale genocide."

"I nibble on what's left from the breakfast and wash it down with some beer while I continue my read."
"Apparently the lions are one of the main reasons why my kin are such a rare sight."
"They arrived in Avalan bent on conquest and establishing their own kingdom, subjugating all of the folk living here."
"Their first target were the humans of Fhreyfall, whom lions viewed as inferior and unfit to live in their new domain."
"They laid waste to the land, butchering entire towns and villages, finally standing at the very gates of the human capital in these lands."
"Fhreyrun was the largest city on the continent, grand and wondrous, a last vestige of the humanity of old."
"The lions had no means of breaching the city with its massive stone walls, so at first they resorted to starving it out…"
"…but the humans of Fhreyfall stood firm, resupplying their city through the river."
"Impatient, the lions decided to terrorise the populace into submission… each night they would catapult half-eaten human cadavers into the city, aimed at breaking the spirit of the defenders."
"But the humans stood firm… days… then week… in the end it wasn't their spirit that failed, but their bodies; sickness and disease overwhelmed the city and after nearly a year of siege, Fhreyrun capitulated."
"To show others the price of such brave defiance, the lions put the city to the sword and torch."
"What follows is a detailed account of rape and plunder, with some paragraphs going as far as calling the lions kin-eaters; something which seems to be one of the most monstrous stigmas an otherkin can bare."
"I must admit I'm relieved to learn that cannibalism between the kins is frowned upon, but equally unsettled that lions resorted to devouring those they considered 'lesser'."
"And it would seem, humans weren't the only ones on the menu, but the Sylvan Folk as well…"
"No wonder otherkin rebelled."
"The rebellion itself is a muddled jumble of dates and events, which spanning a century are easy to confuse."
"Despite being lost half the time, I finally realise why tigers are brought up so much in my context."
"After the success of the Tiger Rebellion, Fhreyfall became a province of the Tiger realm and although now mainly populated by tiger folk, humans are still a sizable minority there."
"It also seems they're very much respected and according to the book, partake in the governance of Tigeron."
"I guess a human Tigerii noble isn't such a crazy idea after all…"
"As for the lions… Tigers have banished them, forcing entire prides into exile; to leave the continent and never to return…"
"A fitting end for those murdering monsters…"
"If at least half of the stuff I read is true, then I definitely do not want to meet a lion."
"I close the book, trying to digest this information."
"It all seems so surreal and very much out of place."
